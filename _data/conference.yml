  The P-RECS workshop is the primary forum for the [ACM Emerging Interest 
  Group (EIG) for Reproducibility and Replicability](https://reproducibility.acm.org/)
  and focuses heavily on practical, actionable aspects of 
  reproducibility in broad areas of computational science and data 
  exploration, with special emphasis on issues in which community 
  collaboration can be essential for adopting novel methodologies, 
  techniques and frameworks aimed at addressing some of the challenges 
  we face today. The workshop brings together researchers and experts to 
  share experiences and advance the state of the art in the reproducible 
  evaluation of computer systems, featuring contributed papers and 
  invited talks.
