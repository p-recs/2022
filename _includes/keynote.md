**Title**: Taking the Pulse of the Reproducibility of Computational Research

**Abstract**: In the spring of 2021, the Practices WG of the ACMâ€™s EIG on Reproducibility and Replicability held a series of community conversations about topics related to the reproducibility of computational research. Five such meeting were held, each focusing on reproducibility through the lens of a particular topic: Principles, Solutions, Training, Publishing, and Preservation. The virtual discussions, which garnered solid interest from a broad range of stakeholders, was captured via the blog, "Taking the Pulse." This keynote will expand on the "Taking the Pulse" series and summarize the main insights from the community. The talk will also reflect on future needs around reproducibility, which will be of interest to P-RECS, the ACM, and the scientific community at large.

**Vicky Rampin**
Vicky is the Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, and subject specialist librarian for data science at New York University Division of Libraries. She supports members of the NYU community in creating efficiently-managed and reproducible research. Vicky's own research centers on integrating reproducible practices into research workflows, advocating openness in all facets of research, and building/contributing to open infrastructure (currently working on Taguette, an free and open source qualitative analysis tool and on ReproZip, a free and open source computational reproducibility tool). She is an alum of the National Digital Stewardship Residency New York (2014-15). Vicky holds a BS in Computer Science and Information Technology as well as a Master of Library and Information Science from Simmons University and a master of Computer Science from NYU (expected August 2022).

**Limor Peer**
Limor is Associate Director for Research and Strategic Initiatives at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS), Yale University. She works primarily on research transparency and reproducibility. Her research interests include the connection between the processes of generating and preserving scientific knowledge. At ISPS, Limor created the ISPS Data Archive, a digital repository for research produced by scholars affiliated with ISPS with a focus on experimental design and methods. She led the project to develop YARD, the Yale Application for Research Data, a workflow tool for reviewing and enhancing research outputs before publication. Limor is co-founder of the CURE (Curation for Reproducibility) Consortium of social science data archives, and has been leading related initiatives at the Research Data Alliance among other organizations. In previous roles, she has conducted research on journalism and public opinion in democracies. Limor holds a BA in Political Science from Tel Aviv University and a Master's and a Doctoral degree in Communication Studies from Northwestern University.
